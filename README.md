# üß†‚ö°Ô∏è Brain Energy Tracker with ChatGPT and Telegram

This self-hosted app uses Telegram to gather daily meal details and feelings from users, analyzing this data with ChatGPT's API to estimate the nutritional content.

## Features

*Daily Logging via Telegram:* Each day, the app sends messages through Telegram asking about your meals and how you feel. These questions are designed to gather detailed information about what you ate during the day.

*ChatGPT-Powered Analysis:* Utilizing your responses sent via Telegram, the app employs the ChatGPT API to analyze and estimate the nutritional content of your daily diet. This includes assessing the amounts of carbohydrates, sugars, and other key nutritional elements of your meals.

*Personal Data Storage:* The app is currently focused on securely storing all collected data in a database. This information, accessible to you, can be used at your discretion. Plans are in place to enhance the app with features for structured data visualization, such as tables, and capabilities to automatically identify dietary patterns in the future.

In its current form, the app acts as a sophisticated tool for data collection and personal health monitoring, leveraging Telegram for convenient daily interactions and ChatGPT's advanced analytics for nutritional insights.
